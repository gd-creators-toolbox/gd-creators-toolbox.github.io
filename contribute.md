The source code for this website can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/gd-creators-toolbox/gd-creators-toolbox.github.io). 

Before you consider contributing, check out the [contributor's guide](/contributors_guide/). If you have any questions, feel free to contact me on Discord at `JoshTheB#1572`.

## Proposing Changes
If you have a problem with a page, click the <a href="https://github.com/gd-creators-toolbox/gd-creators-toolbox.github.io/edit/main/{{page.path}}"><i class="bi bi-file-earmark-code-fill"></i> View page source</a> button which can be found in the footer of every page. From here, you can propose changes to the file. If you aren't familiar with how GitHub works, you can check out the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches) on their site.

## Writing new Tutorials
For writing tutorials, you basically just need to make sure to follow the guidelines in the contributor's guide. It's probably worth messaging me on Discord to ask whether the tutorial you would like to write is something I would agree with adding to the site. Propose new tutorials in a pull request, and I'll either merge it or give feedback on it. Please don't be offended if I don't want to add your tutorial, I am a bit of a perfectionist!

In the future I hope to have more people actively involved in the development of this site, so if that's something you're interested in, again, send me a message on Discord.
