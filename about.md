The idea for this website first came to me when I was having a conversation with another creator in a random Discord server. I can't remember their name, and they probably wouldn't want to be named. They were generally pretty unhappy with their creating skill, but also didn't know how to get any better, or how to construct things in the editor. It occurred to me that while there are resources out there to teach you about the editor, they are all over the place, vary in quality, and are quite hard to find.

For example, I found out about white masking in the comment section of a video on [BrainETR's channel](https://www.youtube.com/@BrainETR). A lot of my knowledge about the editor was learned from [Wulzy](https://www.youtube.com/@Wulzy) but if someone asked me where I learned to do something specific, I wouldn't be able to give you a video, let alone a timestamp.

So, here's my solution. Your one-stop shop for editor tutorials. Obviously I can't write everything myself, so I'm hoping to get more people involved in this project as time goes on. The website is open source, but if you want to help contribute to the site, see the [contribute](/contribute/) page.
